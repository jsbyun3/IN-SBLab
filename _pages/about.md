### **Integrative Neuro-Systems Biology Group at Keimyung University**

We study the principles of olfaction, from sensory dynamics to olfactory perception and decision-making.

Using the ***Drosophila* olfactory system** as a model, we explore how the brain transforms complex sensory inputs into optimal behavioral choices. Our research traces the olfactory information processing pipeline across scales: from the physical dynamics of **ligand-receptor binding** to the high-level **neural algorithms** that drive navigation.

We integrate **computational modeling**, **artificial intelligence**, and **quantitative experiments** to understand how biological systems—from signaling pathways to the *Drosophila* brain—process information and respond to their environment.

👋 We are recruiting! If you are interested in joining, press [here](/2e6aef7eb71680b9815bfaeb20ed8351?pvs=25#2e6aef7eb71680419c88f26d887ba0b6).

## 🔬 What we study

**1. Chemosensory Receptor Dynamics**

We investigate how cells robustly encode external stimuli by studying the dynamics of chemosensory receptors. We aim to understand the fundamental limits of sensory encoding at the molecular interface.

**2. Olfactory Perception & Decision-Making**

We investigate how animals make decisions in complex environments. We integrate behavioral experiments and Artificial Intelligence to decode the algorithms of olfactory processing in *Drosophila*.
**3. Information Processing in Biological Systems**

We use olfaction as a model to uncover universal principles of biological computation. We investigate how biological networks—from biochemical signaling pathways to neural circuits—process information to ensure robust function.

**4. Biological Algorithm Development**

We develop novel computational methods for network inference, optimization, and clustering to interpret high-dimensional biological data.
